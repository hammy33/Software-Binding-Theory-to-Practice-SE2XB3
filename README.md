# Software-Binding-Theory-to-Practice-SE2XB3

This repository includes all lab assignments completed throughout the semester for my Software Engineering and Practice - Binding Theory to Practice course. Various data structures and algorithms were implemented, tested and analyzed. The language used for development was Python. These assignments were completed in groups of 3; my other partners were Adam Mak and Bhavna Pereira. I completed this course with a mark of 4.0.
